# Large Language Models Can Automatically Engineer Features for Few-Shot Tabular Learning #

This repo is the PyTorch code of our paper, which is accepted to ICML 2024.

## Required packages ##
- python == 3.8.10
- torch == 2.0.0
- numpy == 1.24.4
- scikit-learn == 1.3.0
- pandas == 2.0.3
- openai == 0.28.0
- tqdm == 4.66.1
  
## To run the code ##
Check Main.ipynb for running the code. Changing the simulation parameters and data names is enough to run experiments
