- Pregnancies: There is no clear causal relationship between the number of pregnancies and the presence of diabetes. However, it is known that women who have had multiple pregnancies are at a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes.
- Glucose: High levels of glucose in the blood are indicative of diabetes. 
- BloodPressure: There is a correlation between high blood pressure and diabetes, but it is not a definitive indicator.
- SkinThickness: There is no direct causal relationship between skin thickness and diabetes. However, individuals with diabetes may have thicker skin due to certain metabolic changes.
- Insulin: High levels of insulin may indicate the presence of diabetes, especially if accompanied by high glucose levels.

- Pregnancies: There is no clear causal relationship between the number of pregnancies and the likelihood of having diabetes. However, it is possible that a higher number of pregnancies may increase the risk of developing gestational diabetes.
- Glucose: High plasma glucose concentration is a common symptom of diabetes. Therefore, higher glucose levels may indicate a higher likelihood of having diabetes.
- BloodPressure: There is no direct causal relationship between blood pressure and diabetes. However, high blood pressure can be a risk factor for developing diabetes and is often associated with other health conditions that increase the risk.
- SkinThickness: There is no direct causal relationship between skin thickness and diabetes. However, increased skin thickness may be associated with insulin resistance, which is a common characteristic of diabetes.
- Insulin: Insulin is directly related to diabetes, as it is the hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels. Low or zero insulin levels may indicate a higher likelihood of having diabetes.
- BMI: High body mass index (BMI) is a risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes. Therefore, higher BMI values may indicate a higher likelihood of having diabetes.
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: The diabetes pedigree function is a numerical value that represents the genetic influence of diabetes in a patient's family history. Higher values may indicate a higher likelihood of having diabetes.
- Age: Age is a risk factor for developing diabetes, as the likelihood increases with age. Therefore, older individuals may have a higher likelihood of having diabetes.

- Pregnancies: There is no direct causal relationship between the number of times pregnant and the presence of diabetes. However, it is generally known that women with a higher number of pregnancies may have a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes.
- Glucose: High plasma glucose concentration is a common symptom of diabetes. Therefore, higher glucose levels may indicate the presence of diabetes.
- BloodPressure: There is no direct causal relationship between diastolic blood pressure and the presence of diabetes. However, high blood pressure is often associated with diabetes as a comorbidity.
- SkinThickness: There is no direct causal relationship between triceps skin fold thickness and the presence of diabetes. However, individuals with higher skin thickness may have a higher risk of developing insulin resistance, which can lead to diabetes.
- Insulin: Low or zero serum insulin levels may indicate the presence of diabetes, as the body is unable to produce or effectively use insulin.
- BMI: High body mass index is a risk factor for developing diabetes, as it is associated with insulin resistance.
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: The diabetes pedigree function is a genetic risk score that quantifies the risk of developing diabetes based on family history. Higher values indicate a higher risk.
