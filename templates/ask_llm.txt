You are an expert. Given the task description and the list of features and data examples, you are extracting conditions for each answer class to solve the task.

Task: [TASK]

Features:
[FEATURES]

Examples:
[EXAMPLES]

Let's first understand the problem and solve the problem step by step.

Step 1. Analyze the causal relationship or tendency between each feature and task description based on general knowledge and common sense within a short sentence. 

Step 2. Based on the above examples and Step 1's results, infer 10 different conditions per answer, following the format below. The condition should make sense, well match examples, and must match the format for [condition] according to value type.

Format for Response:
[FORMAT]


Format for [Condition]:
For the categorical variable only,
- [Feature_name] is in [list of Categorical_values]
For the numerical variable only,
- [Feature_name] (> or >= or < or <=) [Numerical_value]
- [Feature_name] is within range of [Numerical_range_start, Numerical_range_end]


Answer: 
Step 1. The relationship between each feature and the task description:
